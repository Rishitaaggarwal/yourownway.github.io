    <p style=" font-family:comic sans MS; color:red">Research has shown that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind.
        Maintaining a level of
        physical
        fitness and a
        balanced diet during your time in school will prove to be hugely beneficial to both your physical and mental
        health. Studies show that managing to incorporate even a couple of hours of decent exercise into a week helps in
        increasing not only our self-esteem and overall mood but also improves our mental alertness and ability to
        learn. A balanced diet, rich in essential nutrients, when paired with regular exercise, will ensure that you
        maintain a healthy, happy sense of physical and mental wellbeing, even around stressful exam times and deadlines
